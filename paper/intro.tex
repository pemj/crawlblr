\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:-intro}


Historically, OSNs have benefited from an economy of scale.  As users 
flock to a network, it becomes easier for them to find their friends, 
and it becomes easier for the network to generate ad revenue.  However, 
if this were more than a back-of-the-napkin sort of rule, we would 
expect a single killer-app of social networking to reach 100\% market 
penetration.  Instead, a variety of large social networks continue 
to exist side by side.  Users seem to prefer a series of different 
networks, with different sets of functionality.  While we cannot 
outright discount the possibility that purely social forces have led to the 
propagation of different networks, previous studies on the structures 
of OSNs such as Twitter\cite{kwak2010twitter} and Facebook\cite{brokencitation}
seem to indicate that the functional structure of the content 
distribution/interaction system has a significant influence on what set of 
users is likely to participate in that system, as well as how those users 
are likely to participate in that system.


With that assumption in mind, we posit that tumblr's position as a 
comparatively popular OSN may partially reflect some 
set of functional differences from other social networks.  However, to 
the best of our knowledge, tumblr has not yet been the subject of 
a rigorous research project investigating its structural 
and functional properties.  We propose to carry out an exploratory study, 
investigating several properties of tumblr, positing several preliminary 
theories as to the effects of these properties, and developing a reusable 
model for representing and collecting information from tumblr while so 
doing.

As a consequence of tumblr's structure, we found that the process of 
data collection was best enabled by the construction of a 
tumblr-specific web crawler.  This web crawler was designed to gather 
as much information as was feasible and analyzable within the time-frame 
dictated by the nature of the project.  We present a more complete 
outline of this process in Section \ref{sec:-method}.  We constructed 
our crawler, and deployed it onto a node of the ACISS supercomputing 
cluster at the University of Oregon.  We gathered data in one 24-hr 
round, and two 48-hr rounds, and compiled the data thus gathered into a 
22-gigabyte relational database.  This information was primarily arranged 
as nodes representing users and posts, and edges relating users to 
posts in various ways. Our research questions were then translated into 
queries on that database, also carried out using an ACISS node.

We present the results of our queries, and the analysis of those results, 
in Section \ref{sec:-res}.  We outline the development of a preliminary 
method for classifying user->user relationships, based on available 
user->content relationships.  While this method is computationally 
expensive over larger datasets, we nevertheless manage to 

We present a collection of data indicating the degree to which users 
generally create original content, compared to the degree to which they 
reblog the content of other users.


In Section \ref{sec:-conc}, we consider some implications of the data 
we have gathered, and furthermore posit ideas for future research in 
this direction.
