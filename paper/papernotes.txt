methodology : a breadth-first search (all posts for all users surveyed, but only the first few hundred notes per post, for brevity's sake) over tumblr.



We classify posts by type, where posts can be images, embedded video, text, or responses to questions.

We classify users by the origins and popularity of their posts.  Users act both as content generators as well as content routers, with a certain probability of rebroadcasting particular pieces of content to their own followers.  As pieces of content "interesting" enough

As with most OSNs, Tumblr can be viewed as a peer-to-peer network.  A user may introduce new information to their connected nodes (followers), and those followers may choose to either ignore that information or rebroadcast it to their own followers, either unmodified or with alterations of their own.


While gnutella causes users to rebroadcast based on a TTL, this is a filtered rebroadcast based on interest, a probability function.
