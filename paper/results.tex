  \caption{The bins on the X axis represent percentages of users, grouped by what percentage of their posts are reblogs.  The Y axis indicates the magnitude of the membership within this group.  Overall, we observe that blogs contain an average of 70\% reblogged material, and a median amount of 76\% reblogged material.}

posts, followed most closely by image posts.  This suggests that Tumblr 
is not so far removed from classic blogging sites.
